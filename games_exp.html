I feel the most noteworthy I can say about games would be my mentality. When craeting a game, or any product for that matter, there are two things one can do. Create something new, or refine the old. I personally feel that the AAA industry increasingly sticks to the latter. They never innovate, creating stale experiences that one has played a thousand times before with a new coat of paint. Of course, this is a bit of an exageration as games like Death Stranding, Breath of the Wild beg to differ. However, I feel that these are an exception to the norm. </p>-->
          <!--<p class="p">So where does that lead me? Innovation in the gaming landscape comes from Indie Developers. And that is my motto, to create games that do not only try to break the box, but absolutely destroy it. However, these games are not experimental games, games without any market appeal, as they are niche to a detriment. Quite the opposite, I try to make games inside genres I beleive are stale, with untap potential. Games that follow the status quo so closely that they do not break conventions, making them stale and monotonous. Hence, I hope as you can see from the games below, a innovative game that makes something old, new.</p>-->

                is a bullethell where you want to get shot. Where instead of bullets, you are shot by the musical notes of the music that's playing. All in a battle against the creator of the game (myself) in a game that 
                demolishes the 4th wall (if you could not tell by now) any means necesary.</p>
                <!-- In it battle against the games creator (me), as you battle through levels where the music played is the bullets thrown at you. All the whilst destroying the 4th wall.</p> -->
              <p class="p"><strong>Design:</strong> The games damage mechanic is a big inversion of the bullethell formula, where players normally avoid bullets at all costs. This forces players to always be aggresive as it's the only means of survival.
                Consequently, this makes movement more important, as it enforces survivabiltity and determines the damage output. 
                So unlike a normal roguelike where the player can sit in a corner avoiding damage, in here the player must be always active to progress.</p>
              <p class="p"><strong>Code:</strong> This project has some very interesting frameworks. For example, to implement the songs in the game I had to create txt files which encoded musical measures and the notes being played during the song. </p>

              <!-- OLD TEXT
              <p class="p">This is my most ambitious project yet, and as the time of writing I have been working on it for the last 4 years. My motto for the projec is to: Make everything myself. This includes, music, marketing, coding, spritework, etc. As I aspire to become a full fledged indie developer, I find that resourcefullness is key. I will admit I am not the best at artwork for example, but the experience has allowed me to lean into my strengths, using a retro style that disregards my lack of artistic ability. So even as I go into future projects, I will most likely not have to do everything myself. I will at least a better understanding of what goes on during every stage of production when making a game.</p>
              <p class="p">So what is the game about? So this is a tricky question to answer without spoiling the whole premise of the game. However, what I can say is that it takes the concept of the 4th wall break into its logical maximum. Moreover, I explore the whole concept of the Death of the Author, as I explore if what if the Author can still be kept alive inside a text, as I try to tackle Rolands Barthes.</p>
              <p class="p">In terms of pure game design, I ascribe to the idea of a Genre without Mechanic Design. In other words, I take out parts that are core to a genre, for example, a platformer without jumping. So in the case of this game, its a bullethell without ammo. So to shoot bullets, one must first get shot to be able to shoot back. Moreover, the notes that are shot from enemies, are actually the music that is being played in the music.</p>
              <p class="p">There is so much more I could talk about, regarding the game. However, I feel it's better for me to create my vision, and later talk about it. Also, I must say that I am making the game inside GameMakerStudio 2. Lastly, despite what the trailer says, I have moved the release date for 2022. Game development is a tricky and unpredictable business, so I'll delay it until its ready.</p>

              <p class="p"><strong>What is this?&nbsp;</strong><a href="https://github.com/vittorio-corbo/Equinox" class="in_line_link" target="_blank">Equinox</a> is a First Person Puzzler set in Space! 
                Where your ONLY mode of movement is a Grapple hook, with which you will have to fix the ship! </p>
              <!-- <p class="p"><strong>Game Design:&nbsp;</strong> This game tries to degamify the act of typing. The problem with most typing games is that they players type faster and faster until they fail. And while this is a fun way to measure typing speed, this is a terrible way to teach typing. As a kid you learn how to read not by being forced to read faster and faster, but rather by sheer time and practice. This is what this game does. </p> -->
              <!-- <p class="p"><strong>Engine:&nbsp;</strong>Unity.</p>
              <p class="p"><strong>When did I do this?&nbsp;</strong>This is a game I am currently making as a part of VGDev. </p> -->
              <p class="p"><strong>Design:&nbsp;</strong>grappling as a mechanic already gives players immense freedom for traversal. Removing gravity on top of that provides almost even more freedom. 
                However, as the game is a puzzler this limitless traversal posed problems, as the player could escape any linear puzzle segments. Thus we decided to make the game open world,
              with a strong emphasis in level design to try to recomend a natural progression along the ship, while still keeping an open MetroidVania nature to the game. </p>
              <p class="p"><strong>Role:&nbsp;</strong>I have been the leader of this project within Georgia Tech's game development club. Ontop of managing the project I have worked closely on the design.</p>

      <h3><strong>Engine:&nbsp;</strong>GameMaker Studio 2 || <strong>When did I do this?&nbsp;</strong>July 2020.</h3>
      <p class="p"><strong>What is this?&nbsp;</strong><a href="https://vitoxio.itch.io/alphabet" class="in_line_link" target="_blank">ALPHABET</a> was made for the GMTK 2020 Game Jam (ranked #434 out of 5477), whose theme was: Out of Control. And it is a fusion between twister and snake, in which each letter you grab changes your keybinds.</p>
      <p class="p"><strong>Design:&nbsp;</strong>The game fits the chaotic nature, as it fights the players inate muscle memory as keybinds are completely changed and morrover, the contortion on they keyboard itself. Moreover to the games arcady nature. The player is incited to replay and fight these reflexes.</p>
      <p class="p"><strong>Code:</strong> I coded some stuff lol. dashjfldas
        dsalfjsdakl;fjasl;dkf as;lkdf a</p>
      <!-- <p class="p">Two things I feel that sneak under the radar when playing the game, has to do with the games namesake: ALPHABET. When grabbing letters the player will notice that notes start to play. Most players will not understand why this music is playing, mainly due to how slow most players are. However, the music that is playing is Twinkle-Twinkle little star, which is coincidentally the alphabet song. Hence, the games name.</p> -->
      <!-- <p class="p">As an aside, I am really proud of my performance on the Game Jam, as I came out 434 out of 5477 game submissions, which is especially good considering this was my first serious Game Jam, and moreover the largest Game Jam ever made at the time. As a whole, I hold this game close, not only because of how it did, but rather by giving an unique spin into the snake-like game genre.</p> -->
      <p class="p"><strong>Cool Fact:&nbsp;</strong>as the player obtains letters, musical notes begin to play. Most players do not understand the nature of this, due to their lack of speed and thus the understanding of the music. However, the song that is playing is twinkle twinkle little star, which most people don't know is the same song as the alphabet, hence the games name.</p>

      <!-- OLD TEXT
      <p class="p">This game was made for the GMTK 2020 Game Jam. With the theme of: Out of Control. I feel that the best mindset of any Game Jam is to keep it simple. Feature creep is something that easily seeps into game production. So to keep things in check I always try to create only the most essential aspects of a game first, get them working, and only after, if there is time, add other features. So for this Jam, I decided to make a snake-like esque game in GameMakerStudio 2. The catch of the game is that when grabbing a letter, it changes the players keybindings into the letter they grabbed.</p>
      <p class="p">The idea of the game is to work similar to the family game Twister. Where the player must contort into strange positions to win. So ALPHABET messes with the players muscle memories, as they must fight their instincts to move around. This is then further elevated by the games arcady nature. As it incites players to get better times, making them replay the game to get better and fight their muscle memory.</p>
      <p class="p">Two things I feel that sneak under the radar when playing the game, has to do with the games namesake: ALPHABET. When grabbing letters the player will notice that notes start to play. Most players will not understand why this music is playing, mainly due to how slow most players are. However, the music that is playing is Twinkle-Twinkle little star, which is coincidentally the alphabet song. Hence, the games name.</p>
      <p class="p">As an aside, I am really proud of my performance on the Game Jam, as I came out 434 out of 5477 game submissions, which is especially good considering this was my first serious Game Jam, and moreover the largest Game Jam ever made at the time. As a whole, I hold this game close, not only because of how it did, but rather by giving an unique spin into the snake-like game genre.</p>

        <!--<p class="p">There are many lofty things I could say about videogames here, wanting to make them for a living, makes it so I often have too much to say about them. I feel the most noteworthy I can say about games would be my mentality. When craeting a game, or any product for that matter, there are two things one can do. Create something new, or refine the old. I personally feel that the AAA industry increasingly sticks to the latter. They never innovate, creating stale experiences that one has played a thousand times before with a new coat of paint. Of course, this is a bit of an exageration as games like Death Stranding, Breath of the Wild beg to differ. However, I feel that these are an exception to the norm. </p>-->
        <!--<p class="p">So where does that lead me? Innovation in the gaming landscape comes from Indie Developers. And that is my motto, to create games that do not only try to break the box, but absolutely destroy it. However, these games are not experimental games, games without any market appeal, as they are niche to a detriment. Quite the opposite, I try to make games inside genres I beleive are stale, with untap potential. Games that follow the status quo so closely that they do not break conventions, making them stale and monotonous. Hence, I hope as you can see from the games below, a innovative game that makes something old, new.</p>-->

              is a bullethell where you want to get shot. Where instead of bullets, you are shot by the musical notes of the music that's playing. All in a battle against the creator of the game (myself) in a game that 
              demolishes the 4th wall (if you could not tell by now) any means necesary.</p>
              <!-- In it battle against the games creator (me), as you battle through levels where the music played is the bullets thrown at you. All the whilst destroying the 4th wall.</p> -->
            <p class="p"><strong>Design:</strong> The games damage mechanic is a big inversion of the bullethell formula, where players normally avoid bullets at all costs. This forces players to always be aggresive as it's the only means of survival.
              Consequently, this makes movement more important, as it enforces survivabiltity and determines the damage output. 
              So unlike a normal roguelike where the player can sit in a corner avoiding damage, in here the player must be always active to progress.</p>
            <p class="p"><strong>Code:</strong> This project has some very interesting frameworks. For example, to implement the songs in the game I had to create txt files which encoded musical measures and the notes being played during the song. </p>

            <!-- OLD TEXT
            <p class="p">This is my most ambitious project yet, and as the time of writing I have been working on it for the last 4 years. My motto for the projec is to: Make everything myself. This includes, music, marketing, coding, spritework, etc. As I aspire to become a full fledged indie developer, I find that resourcefullness is key. I will admit I am not the best at artwork for example, but the experience has allowed me to lean into my strengths, using a retro style that disregards my lack of artistic ability. So even as I go into future projects, I will most likely not have to do everything myself. I will at least a better understanding of what goes on during every stage of production when making a game.</p>
            <p class="p">So what is the game about? So this is a tricky question to answer without spoiling the whole premise of the game. However, what I can say is that it takes the concept of the 4th wall break into its logical maximum. Moreover, I explore the whole concept of the Death of the Author, as I explore if what if the Author can still be kept alive inside a text, as I try to tackle Rolands Barthes.</p>
            <p class="p">In terms of pure game design, I ascribe to the idea of a Genre without Mechanic Design. In other words, I take out parts that are core to a genre, for example, a platformer without jumping. So in the case of this game, its a bullethell without ammo. So to shoot bullets, one must first get shot to be able to shoot back. Moreover, the notes that are shot from enemies, are actually the music that is being played in the music.</p>
            <p class="p">There is so much more I could talk about, regarding the game. However, I feel it's better for me to create my vision, and later talk about it. Also, I must say that I am making the game inside GameMakerStudio 2. Lastly, despite what the trailer says, I have moved the release date for 2022. Game development is a tricky and unpredictable business, so I'll delay it until its ready.</p>

            with a strong emphasis in level design to try to recomend a natural progression along the ship, while still keeping an open MetroidVania nature to the game. </p>

And while this is a fun way to measure typing speed, this is a terrible way to learn typing.  trying to speedrun a book, this is not how kids transition into reading childrens books to Harry Potter. This growth comes from routine practice. Which slowly as time goes on, as one reads more and more, one gets more familiar and comfortable reading, thus becoming a better reader.

            <p class="p"><strong>Design:&nbsp;</strong> This game tries to degamify the act of typing. The problem with most typing games is that they players type faster and faster until they fail. And while this is a fun way to measure typing speed, this is a terrible way to teach typing. As a kid you learn how to read not by being forced to read faster and faster, but rather by sheer time and practice. This is what this game does. </p>

It's still a game, as there is a tug of war between what the player needs to type, vs the game, which makes the player need to write ridiculous lines to progress. The best thing is once the game is beaten, options are added to costumise the typing experience, so players can add errors made while typing, words per minute, etc. Allowing the game to be costumized to ones personal typing goals.

            <!--OLD TEXT
            <p class="p"> I first had the idea of creating a typing game when I first got into college. I wanted another way to study through my notes, as I found that reading them out wasn't as engaging. So combining this, with a new found interest in how to improve my typing, by using websites such as keybr.com, I decided to create a simple piece of python code that enabled me to type my notes out. </p>
            <p class="p"> This was all this idea was for quite some time. A simple code that would take a text file to type out. Until some time later I had to create an original game for a game studies class. Inspired in the readings on player agency and gamification, I decided to expand on this simple code, and turn it into a game.</p>
            <p = class="p"> But you might be asking: what makes this typing game unique? Well its simple, it's the most bearbones and least "vidoegamey" typing game possible. At first this sounds like a huge boon for my game, until one realises how bad the average typing games is. As these games are overly gamified. The average typing game implores the user to type increasingly fast as enemies come onto the screen until they reach can't keep up anymore and die. However, I feel that typing is similar to how one learns how to read. One does not get better at reading by trying to speedrun a book, this is not how kids transition into reading childrens books to Harry Potter. This growth comes from routine practice. Which slowly as time goes on, as one reads more and more, one gets more familiar and comfortable reading, thus becoming a better reader.

            <!-- <p class="p">This project is an interesting project. I first had the idea of creating a typing game when I first got into college and I wanted another way to study through my notes. I was too bored having to read them out. So combining a new found interest in how to type properly, using websites such as keybr.com to improve my typing. I decided to create a simple piece of python code inwhich I could privide it a text file to then type out. <br> This was all the idea was for a time, until some time later I had to create a full fledged original game for a game studies class I was taking.

Well its simple, its the most bearbones and least vidoegamy typing game possible. At first this sounds like a huge boon for my game, until one realises how bad modern typing games are.

            <p class="p"> <strong>Design: </strong> This game was an experiment on 3D level design. The ability to teleport anywhere gives many limitations to level design which makes creating puzzles even harder. Hence adding see throgh walls and ungrappable walls was crucial. Nonetheless, the abilty to just point and click simplifies the experience, hence players do not need to worry about systems such as movmeent (WASD) or gravity when playing.</p>

  <p class="notopmargin"><font face="times new roman" size="4">
  This game has been my life's work, not literally, for the last two years, above I have left a video with some of the gameplay.
  The game started as an answer to the frustration I've built up towards bullet hells. These games have always been about barraging the player with bullets,
  however, all the player must do is evade these bullets, while one endlessly tries to shoot the enemies with endless amounts of ammunition.
  The approach I took for this game was to make both the act of shooting and evading bullets more active.
  I made it so the only way the player can get a bullet is to grab one directly from the enemy, however,
  the player can only hold one bullet at a time unless the player dashes into the bullet shot adding one more bullet that the player can hold.
  This simple change made so the bullets shot by the enemy become more than big red orbs one must avoid, but rather they are the source of the gameplay,
  this made so the act of moving has more meaning and also bullets become far more valuable.
  <br />
  <br />
  As a result of this approach something interesting happened.
  Death occurred far more often, all due to the fact players could only hold one bullet at a time. I realized that if I added more bullets that could be held
  the game would lose its appeal and the player would just become a bullet sponge. I then decided to add a time mechanic to make the game less harsh.
  This mechanic is not shown inside the gameplay above, as it's not integral to the main gameplay loop. Nonetheless, adding the ability to slow down time and
  as well speed it up adds far more control to the player to dodge between bullets, making movement far more interesting and flow better.
  <br />
  <br />
  The artstyle may not look the prettiest, however, I built it around a similar look to Pacman which because of the limits of the hardware complex images couldn't be shown.
  Hence, the look was based on outlines and a neon-like look. As I personally don't have much artistic ability and because I decided to make this game alone
  I chose this look to center more in colors and outlines rather than in graphics themselves.
  <br />
  <br />

  The music, as I showed before, is of my own composition, and I worked endlessly to make sure that the bullets shot match the notes played, to the point that I decided to make the
  bullets be the same notes played. I am not sure if I will change this aspect, it all depends on where I decide the overall themes of the game to be.
  <br>
  <br />
  All in all, this game has been extremely interesting and it has teached me a lot about game design, at the moment I am trying to make the game more artistic.
  I am trying to refine the look of the game, and work on the overall story or point of the game. For the meantime it's been a complex process but I hope its not too long
  before I post here the fruits of that work.

  During 7th grade till my Junior year I was part of my school's Robotics team, Error 404.
  Which after many years of hard work and losing a bunch we finally went to compete internationally in Estonia representing Chile.
  It was a huge moment for the team and I loved to meet all kinds of people from all over the world all joined for our passion for robotics.

    It may not look like much, but making this website has been a sizable project on itself, it started inside my computer science class as everyone had to make a website,
    however, I have tweaked to no avail and upgraded it to what it can be seen now.
    There are many things I wish to do, like using bootstrap to make the website look good on mobile devices, as the code now is a bit too rough for my liking.
    Regardless, I hope it has been able to accurately show who I am.
