        <h2><a name="about">About Miscellaneous</a></h2>
				<div class="text_div">

            <p class="p">I find that the word miscellaneous can be a mouthfull. In a way its so extra and well... miscellaneous. So in that spirit, here I've compiled all of those ideas & projects that do not neatly fit into a category. </p>

        <!--THIS WEBSITE-->
        <h2><a name="web">This website</a></h2>
				<div class="text_div">
            <p class="p">A big mindset I have in general, is to make things myself. This sometimes can be a detriment, its harder to learn the guitar alone that with a teacher. However, being to learn something without having to rely in anybody is a huge asset. I know I could've used extensive libraries to make the process of making this website. Nonetheless, I beleive that making something from scratch gives you a better grasp of how something works, so when you actually come to use those libraries you use them not as a crutch from a lack of knowledge. Rather they take the tedium out of having to reinvent the wheel when applying a feature that somoene else already made. So, all you can see inside this website has been made by yours truly.</p>
            <p class="p">In terms of the overall asthetic, I have always been a fan of retro looks. Games such as pacman has a really unique neon look that I feel is often underlooked. Moreover, the use of black counters traditional white background websites, creating something retro but still clean. And that is one of the main reasons I use this aesthetic in my games. Moreover, it allows sprites to be more simplistic, and more about outline and color, rather than graphical fidelity. Which works especially well, when I am not the best at creating models and spritework. Finally, I am really keen on the use of orange, apart from it being an unpraciated color, it creates a nice constrant with black. Making it readable, while still being pleasing to the eye, something that a color like red does not achieve.</p>

            <p class="p">For the class, LMC 2700: Intro to Computational Media, I had the assignement to recreate an image into a-frame. A platform in which one can creat 3D objects inside an Html website. Being the huge Zelda fan that I am, I could not help myself from recreating the iconic pedestal from Ocarina of Time. The fruit of these efforts can be seen <a href="framed.html" target="_blank" class="in_line_link">Here.</a></p>
            <!-- <p><a href="framed.html" target="_blank" style="color: #ff7f27">a frame website. For class i had to make a 3d object using html and this is what i made</a></p> -->

            <p class="p">As I aspire to become make game developer full time, I often analyse various games. I disect their design, understanding what makes them tick, which then provides me a jumping point when then creating my own. In any artform, one needs to be introspective to know what came before, to be able to create what comes next. For this specific essay on Doki Doki Literature Club, I disected its use of the 4th wall, and how it bridges the gap between the player and the game. And And without spoiling too much, it's this kind of wall break, that I am trying to take into a whole other level, as I work in The Un-BEATable Game.</p>

    Since my Senior year I jog four times a week to relieve stress and of course to be healthy.
    At the moment I am training for a marathon, as for the moment I have only ran half. It's been a wild journey and I have a lot left to go!
    These pictures are from my first half-marathon.
