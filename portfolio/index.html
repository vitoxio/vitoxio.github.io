In it alongside a team  The game is Madlibs if words were 100% randomly assigned.</p> -->
          <h4>Overview</h4>
          <p class="p">At <strong>Georgia Tech</strong> I worked as an <strong>Undergraduate Researcher</strong>, working on <strong>Homebrew</strong> games for the <strong>SEGA Dreamcast</strong>. In this <strong>Vertically Integrated Project (VIP)</strong>, I worked alongside other students and under professor: <strong>Aaron Lanterman</strong>. </p>
          <!-- <p class="p"> <strong>Design: </strong> This game shows that randomness is not always ideal. The game is a huge mess, but through that you can see the problem with true randomness as it does not allow any authorial control. </p> -->
        

          <h4>What I did</h4>
          <ul class="square">
            <li>Developed 2D & 3D homebrew games, alongside 5 students, in OpenGL under professor Aaron Lanterman</li>
            <li>Researched a diverse array of other engines and workflows due to poor online resources</li>
            <li>Created textures using proprietary format</li>
            <li>Documented work and created technical guides</li>
            <li>Burned and ran games on original hardware </li>
          </ul>

          <!-- <h4>More Info</h4>
          <p class="p"> Most of the work done for the project was with documenting and understanding how the SEGA Dreamcast works. Because of the short-life of the console and lack of popularity the information about homebrew is sparse and poorly documented.</p> -->

                    Consequently, this makes movement more meaningful, as the more the player moves and weaves in and out of combat the better they will do.

                    Another, decision made was making the player <strong>dash towards the crosshair</strong>, not towards the players movement direction. This decision is very antithetical to how twin-stick shooters normally work. 
                    In essence, this gives players more agency in their aim. Normally, players will only follow players with their crosshair, only switching their positioning to aim to the next foe. 
                    Here players must switch between movement and shooting, giving a tug between both systems, creating more interesting combat scenarios and gives pros and cons to the system.
                    <!-- So unlike a normal roguelike where the player can sit in a corner avoiding damage, in here the player must be always active to progress. -->

              <!-- OLD TEXT
              <p class="p">This is my most ambitious project yet, and as the time of writing I have been working on it for the last 4 years. My motto for the projec is to: Make everything myself. This includes, music, marketing, coding, spritework, etc. As I aspire to become a full fledged indie developer, I find that resourcefullness is key. I will admit I am not the best at artwork for example, but the experience has allowed me to lean into my strengths, using a retro style that disregards my lack of artistic ability. So even as I go into future projects, I will most likely not have to do everything myself. I will at least a better understanding of what goes on during every stage of production when making a game.</p>
              <p class="p">So what is the game about? So this is a tricky question to answer without spoiling the whole premise of the game. However, what I can say is that it takes the concept of the 4th wall break into its logical maximum. Moreover, I explore the whole concept of the Death of the Author, as I explore if what if the Author can still be kept alive inside a text, as I try to tackle Rolands Barthes.</p>
              <p class="p">In terms of pure game design, I ascribe to the idea of a Genre without Mechanic Design. In other words, I take out parts that are core to a genre, for example, a platformer without jumping. So in the case of this game, its a bullethell without ammo. So to shoot bullets, one must first get shot to be able to shoot back. Moreover, the notes that are shot from enemies, are actually the music that is being played in the music.</p>
              <p class="p">There is so much more I could talk about, regarding the game. However, I feel it's better for me to create my vision, and later talk about it. Also, I must say that I am making the game inside GameMakerStudio 2. Lastly, despite what the trailer says, I have moved the release date for 2022. Game development is a tricky and unpredictable business, so I'll delay it until its ready.</p>

          <h4>Overview</h4>
          <p class="p"><strong>Equinox</strong> is a Open World First Person Puzzler set in Space! Where your ONLY mode of movement is a <strong>Grapple hook</strong>, with which you will have to fix the ship! </p>
          <!-- <p class="p"><strong>Game Design:&nbsp;</strong> This game tries to degamify the act of typing. The problem with most typing games is that they players type faster and faster until they fail. And while this is a fun way to measure typing speed, this is a terrible way to teach typing. As a kid you learn how to read not by being forced to read faster and faster, but rather by sheer time and practice. This is what this game does. </p> -->
          <!-- <p class="p"><strong>Engine:&nbsp;</strong>Unity.</p>
          <p class="p"><strong>When did I do this?&nbsp;</strong>This is a game I am currently making as a part of VGDev. </p> -->
          <h4>Project Lead</h4>
          <p class="p">As the Project Lead I worked with all areas of production to get the game done in a span of a <strong>4 months</strong>. I had to create <strong>Trello</strong> tasks, and manage weekly meetings with every sub-team. We worked with an <strong>AGILE</strong> framework, working in <strong>sprints</strong> that lasted <strong>3 weeks</strong>. As the Project Manager, I not only managed every part of development, but I also worked alongside members, flexing my abilities, to truly understand and <strong>work</strong> as a team-member in <strong>every</strong> stage of the process.</p>
          
          <h4>Game Design</h4>
          <p class="p">Grappling as a mechanic already gives players immense freedom for traversal. <strong>Removing gravity</strong> on top of that provides almost even more freedom. 
            However, as the game is a puzzler this limitless traversal posed problems, as the player could escape any linear puzzle segments. Thus we decided to make the game <strong>open world</strong>,
          with a strong emphasis in level design to try to recomend a natural progression along the ship, while still keeping an open <strong>MetroidVania</strong> nature to the game. </p>

                <li>Give Players: Roll, Pitch, and Yaw. This gives the player complete control of the camera, so they can move in all directions.</li>
                <li>The player can attach themselves to walls. From there they can pull objects around the gameworld. </li>

            is a plant planting puzzler, where you try to make your little plants survive in a world ravaged by war. </p>
          <h4>Design</h4>
          <p class="p">This game was experiment in the area of Systems Design in the aspect of Resource Management, 
          as the player has a limited amount of water that they must learn to manage properly. Moreover, this game was meant to be less mechanical and tell a deeper story. 
          It exploits the dichotomy of plants which represent life and the war and death that is happening outside the window. Which shows a very grim take of war.</p>
          
          <h4>Code</h4>
          <p class="p">As a systems game this really pushed my boundaries and skills as a developer. As I had to implement proper coding patterns to build a systems heavy game.</p>

          <p class="p"> This is a very simple project which I made for another gamejam. this not too cool, but it was fun </p>
          <p = class="p"> But you might be asking: what makes this typing game unique? Well its simple, it's the most bearbones and least "vidoegamey" typing game possible. At first this sounds like a huge boon for my game, until one realises how bad the average typing games is. As these games are overly gamified. The average typing game implores the user to type increasingly fast as enemies come onto the screen until they reach can't keep up anymore and die. However, I feel that typing is similar to how one learns how to read. One does not get better at reading by trying to speedrun a book, this is not how kids transition into reading childrens books to Harry Potter. This growth comes from routine practice. Which slowly as time goes on, as one reads more and more, one gets more familiar and comfortable reading, thus becoming a better reader. So it is this principle I used at the basis of my typing game. </p>
          <p = class="p">In the game, players are only required to type what is on screen, there is no music, no feedback for wrong keystrokes, nothing. So, it creats this safe environment where the worst of typers can practice without any negative feedback to deter their growth. So, the game is destilled to just the essence of typing. It's still a game, as there is a tug of war between what the player needs to type, vs the game, which makes the player need to write ridiculous lines to progress. The best thing is once the game is beaten, options are added to costumise the typing experience, so players can add errors made while typing, words per minute, etc. Allowing the game to be costumized to ones personal typing goals. Which is then further cemented by the ability to change the games .txt files, to whatever custom text the user wants to use. Which allows me to be able to still study my class notes in peace.

          <h4>Overview</h4>
          <p class="p"><strong>Dry</strong> is a survival horror game where you are stranded in an abandoned oil rig looking for gasoline to refill your car and escape. However, you might not be alone in this place. </p>

          <p class="p">For this game I worked as one of the game designers. For example helping flesh out the two hand mechanic. In which the player can only grab two items at once (one per hand) and nothing more. And how items and collectibles would work as the player tries to escape the area.</p>

          <p class="p"> This is a very simple project which I made for another gamejam. this not too cool, but it was fun </p>
          <p = class="p"> But you might be asking: what makes this typing game unique? Well its simple, it's the most bearbones and least "vidoegamey" typing game possible. At first this sounds like a huge boon for my game, until one realises how bad the average typing games is. As these games are overly gamified. The average typing game implores the user to type increasingly fast as enemies come onto the screen until they reach can't keep up anymore and die. However, I feel that typing is similar to how one learns how to read. One does not get better at reading by trying to speedrun a book, this is not how kids transition into reading childrens books to Harry Potter. This growth comes from routine practice. Which slowly as time goes on, as one reads more and more, one gets more familiar and comfortable reading, thus becoming a better reader. So it is this principle I used at the basis of my typing game. </p>
          <p = class="p">In the game, players are only required to type what is on screen, there is no music, no feedback for wrong keystrokes, nothing. So, it creats this safe environment where the worst of typers can practice without any negative feedback to deter their growth. So, the game is destilled to just the essence of typing. It's still a game, as there is a tug of war between what the player needs to type, vs the game, which makes the player need to write ridiculous lines to progress. The best thing is once the game is beaten, options are added to costumise the typing experience, so players can add errors made while typing, words per minute, etc. Allowing the game to be costumized to ones personal typing goals. Which is then further cemented by the ability to change the games .txt files, to whatever custom text the user wants to use. Which allows me to be able to still study my class notes in peace.

          <h4>Overview</h4>
          <p class="p"><strong>ALPHABET</strong> is a fusion between Snake and Twister, where each letter grabbed changes your keybinds as you collect all the letters of the alphabet!</p>
          <h4>Game Jam</h4>
          <p class="p"> Competed in the <strong>GMTK 2020 Game Jam</strong>, whose theme was: <strong>Out of Control</strong>. Ranked <strong>#434</strong> out of <strong>5477</strong>.</p>
          <h4>Design</h4>
          <p class="p">The game fits the chaotic nature, as it fights the players inate muscle memory as keybinds are completely changed and morrover, the contortion on they keyboard itself. Moreover to the games arcady nature. The player is incited to replay and fight these reflexes.</p>
          <h4>Code</h4>
          <p class="p">Create an input system that can dynamically change keybinds.</p>
          <h4>Cool Fact</h4>
          <p class="p">As the player obtains letters, musical notes begin to play. Most players do not understand the nature of this, due to their lack of speed and thus the understanding of the music. However, the song that is playing is twinkle twinkle little star, which most people don't know is the same song as the alphabet, hence the games name.</p>
          
            <!-- <p class="p">Two things I feel that sneak under the radar when playing the game, has to do with the games namesake: ALPHABET. When grabbing letters the player will notice that notes start to play. Most players will not understand why this music is playing, mainly due to how slow most players are. However, the music that is playing is Twinkle-Twinkle little star, which is coincidentally the alphabet song. Hence, the games name.</p> -->
          <!-- <p class="p">As an aside, I am really proud of my performance on the Game Jam, as I came out 434 out of 5477 game submissions, which is especially good considering this was my first serious Game Jam, and moreover the largest Game Jam ever made at the time.

          <!-- OLD TEXT
          <p class="p">This game was made for the GMTK 2020 Game Jam. With the theme of: Out of Control. I feel that the best mindset of any Game Jam is to keep it simple. Feature creep is something that easily seeps into game production. So to keep things in check I always try to create only the most essential aspects of a game first, get them working, and only after, if there is time, add other features. So for this Jam, I decided to make a snake-like esque game in GameMakerStudio 2. The catch of the game is that when grabbing a letter, it changes the players keybindings into the letter they grabbed.</p>
          <p class="p">The idea of the game is to work similar to the family game Twister. Where the player must contort into strange positions to win. So ALPHABET messes with the players muscle memories, as they must fight their instincts to move around. This is then further elevated by the games arcady nature. As it incites players to get better times, making them replay the game to get better and fight their muscle memory.</p>

            <p class="p"><strong>EVERY (few) WORDS ARE RANDOM</strong> was made for GMTK's 2022 game jam, whose theme was: Roll of the Dice. The game is Madlibs if words were 100% randomly assigned.</p>
            <h4>Game Jam</h4>
            <p class="p">Competed in the <strong>GMTK 2022 Game Jam</strong>, whose theme was: <strong>Ramdom</strong>. Ranked <strong>#5038</strong> out of <strong> 6,067</strong>.</p>
            <!-- <p class="p"> <strong>Game design: </strong> This game shows that randomness is not always ideal. The game is a huge mess, but through that you can see the problem with true randomness as it does not allow any authorial control. </p> -->

            <p class="p">This game shows that randomness is not always ideal. The game is a huge mess, but through that you can see the problem with true randomness as it does not allow any authorial control. </p>
            <h4>Code</h4>
            <p class="p">I generated random words from a pool of 200000 words, by using the dictionary wordlist from: <strong>F*ck Every Word 2.0</strong> on X.com</p>
            <!-- <p = class="p"> <strong>Game design: </strong> In retrospect I have realized game does not have the biggest appeal. The concept shows how randomness is something exists better when its not in excess. </p> -->
            <!-- <p = class="p">In the game, players are only required to type what is on screen, there is no music, no feedback for wrong keystrokes, nothing. So, it creats this safe environment where the worst of typers can practice without any negative feedback to deter their growth. So, the game is destilled to just the essence of typing. It's still a game, as there is a tug of war between what the player needs to type, vs the game, which makes the player need to write ridiculous lines to progress. The best thing is once the game is beaten, options are added to costumise the typing experience, so players can add errors made while typing, words per minute, etc. Allowing the game to be costumized to ones personal typing goals. Which is then further cemented by the ability to change the games .txt files, to whatever custom text the user wants to use. Which allows me to be able to still study my class notes in peace.

            <p class="p"><strong>Childlike Mischief</strong> is a game in a typical never-ending summer, where you have to find a way to see the sunset, as the mother stops you at the end of every day. All in a way a kid would: by being a little rascal!.</p>
            <!-- <p class="p"><strong>Design:&nbsp;</strong>The game fits the chaotic nature, as it fights the players inate muscle memory as keybinds are completely changed and morrover, the contortion on they keyboard itself. Moreover to the games arcady nature. The player is incited to replay and fight these reflexes.</p> -->
            <h4>Design</h4>
            <p class="p">Created a game that merges Untitled Goose Game with Outer Wilds, to create a game with a repeating loop that makes players try to watch the sunset in a typical summer. Created a complete quest chain to complete the time-loop.</p>
            <h4>Note</h4>
            <p class="p">Game is unfinished.</p>
            <!-- <p class="p">Two things I feel that sneak under the radar when playing the game, has to do with the games namesake: ALPHABET.

However, the music that is playing is Twinkle-Twinkle little star, which is coincidentally the alphabet song. Hence, the games name.</p> -->

            <h4>Overview</h4>
            <p class="p"><strong>Typing is Hard</strong> is a typing game (duh) where what you type is at the mercy of the games questionable creator. </p>
            <!-- <p class="p"> The problem with most typing games is that they make the player type faster and faster until they fail. And while this is a fun way to measure typing speed, this is a terrible way to learn typing.  trying to speedrun a book, this is not how kids transition into reading childrens books to Harry Potter. This growth comes from routine practice. Which slowly as time goes on, as one reads more and more, one gets more familiar and comfortable reading, thus becoming a better reader. So it is this principle I used at the basis of my typing game. </p> -->
            <h4>Design</h4>
            <p class="p">This game tries to degamify the act of typing. The problem with most typing games is that they players type faster and faster until they fail. And while this is a fun way to measure typing speed, this is a terrible way to teach typing. As a kid you learn how to read not by being forced to read faster and faster, but rather by sheer time and practice. This is what this game does. </p>
            <h4>Code</h4>
            <p class="p">Introduced stats like: wpm, error detection, and consistency to allow people to practice thier typing. Moreover, players can input their own custom .txt files to type out anything they desire.</p>

            <!-- <p class="p">In the game, players are only required to type what is on screen, there is no music, no feedback for wrong keystrokes, nothing. So, it creats this safe environment where the worst of typers can practice without any negative feedback to deter their growth. So, the game is destilled to just the essence of typing. It's still a game, as there is a tug of war between what the player needs to type, vs the game, which makes the player need to write ridiculous lines to progress. The best thing is once the game is beaten, options are added to costumise the typing experience, so players can add errors made while typing, words per minute, etc. Allowing the game to be costumized to ones personal typing goals. Which is then further cemented by the ability to change the games .txt files, to whatever custom text the user wants to use. Which allows me to be able to still study my class notes in peace.

            <!--OLD TEXT
            <p class="p"> I first had the idea of creating a typing game when I first got into college. I wanted another way to study through my notes, as I found that reading them out wasn't as engaging. So combining this, with a new found interest in how to improve my typing, by using websites such as keybr.com, I decided to create a simple piece of python code that enabled me to type my notes out. </p>
            <p class="p"> This was all this idea was for quite some time. A simple code that would take a text file to type out. Until some time later I had to create an original game for a game studies class. Inspired in the readings on player agency and gamification, I decided to expand on this simple code, and turn it into a game.</p>
            <p = class="p"> But you might be asking: what makes this typing game unique? Well its simple, it's the most bearbones and least "vidoegamey" typing game possible. At first this sounds like a huge boon for my game, until one realises how bad the average typing games is. As these games are overly gamified. The average typing game implores the user to type increasingly fast as enemies come onto the screen until they reach can't keep up anymore and die. However, I feel that typing is similar to how one learns how to read. One does not get better at reading by trying to speedrun a book, this is not how kids transition into reading childrens books to Harry Potter. This growth comes from routine practice. Which slowly as time goes on, as one reads more and more, one gets more familiar and comfortable reading, thus becoming a better reader. So it is this principle I used at the basis of my typing game. </p>

              <h4>Overview</h4>
              <p class="p"><strong>Grapple Man</strong> is First Person Puzzler where you cannot move. Rather you can teleport to wherever you look to reach the end. </p>
              <h4>Design</h4>
              <p class="p">This game was an experiment on 3D level design. The ability to teleport anywhere gives many limitations to level design which makes creating puzzles even harder. Hence adding see throgh walls and ungrappable walls was crucial. Nonetheless, the abilty to just point and click simplifies the experience, hence players do not need to worry about systems such as movmeent (WASD) or gravity when playing.</p>
              <h4>Code</h4>
              <p class="p">While very simplistic, the lack of code shows how a fun game can be created by removing elements in a game gerne, as camera movement is the only input.</p>
              <h4>Cool Fact</h4>
              <p class="p"> This game is the one that was the inspiration and built the groundwork for: Equinox (shown above).</p>
