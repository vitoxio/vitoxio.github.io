<p class="nobottommargin"> <font face="times new roman" size="6"> <u>About the Game: </u> </p>
  <p class="notopmargin"><font face="times new roman" size="4">
  This game has been my life's work, not literally, for the last two years, above I have left a video with some of the gameplay.
  The game started as an answer to the frustration I've built up towards bullet hells. These games have always been about barraging the player with bullets,
  however, all the player must do is evade these bullets, while one endlessly tries to shoot the enemies with endless amounts of ammunition.
  The approach I took for this game was to make both the act of shooting and evading bullets more active.
  I made it so the only way the player can get a bullet is to grab one directly from the enemy, however,
  the player can only hold one bullet at a time unless the player dashes into the bullet shot adding one more bullet that the player can hold.
  This simple change made so the bullets shot by the enemy become more than big red orbs one must avoid, but rather they are the source of the gameplay,
  this made so the act of moving has more meaning and also bullets become far more valuable.
  <br />
  <br />
  As a result of this approach something interesting happened.
  Death occurred far more often, all due to the fact players could only hold one bullet at a time. I realized that if I added more bullets that could be held
  the game would lose its appeal and the player would just become a bullet sponge. I then decided to add a time mechanic to make the game less harsh.
  This mechanic is not shown inside the gameplay above, as it's not integral to the main gameplay loop. Nonetheless, adding the ability to slow down time and
  as well speed it up adds far more control to the player to dodge between bullets, making movement far more interesting and flow better.
  <br />
  <br />
  The artstyle may not look the prettiest, however, I built it around a similar look to Pacman which because of the limits of the hardware complex images couldn't be shown.
  Hence, the look was based on outlines and a neon-like look. As I personally don't have much artistic ability and because I decided to make this game alone
  I chose this look to center more in colors and outlines rather than in graphics themselves.
  <br />
  <br />

  The music, as I showed before, is of my own composition, and I worked endlessly to make sure that the bullets shot match the notes played, to the point that I decided to make the
  bullets be the same notes played. I am not sure if I will change this aspect, it all depends on where I decide the overall themes of the game to be.
  <br>
  <br />
  All in all, this game has been extremely interesting and it has teached me a lot about game design, at the moment I am trying to make the game more artistic.
  I am trying to refine the look of the game, and work on the overall story or point of the game. For the meantime it's been a complex process but I hope its not too long
  before I post here the fruits of that work.

<p class="notopmargin"><font face="times new roman" size="4">
  During 7th grade till my Junior year I was part of my school's Robotics team, Error 404.
  Which after many years of hard work and losing a bunch we finally went to compete internationally in Estonia representing Chile.
  It was a huge moment for the team and I loved to meet all kinds of people from all over the world all joined for our passion for robotics.

    It may not look like much, but making this website has been a sizable project on itself, it started inside my computer science class as everyone had to make a website,
    however, I have tweaked to no avail and upgraded it to what it can be seen now.
    There are many things I wish to do, like using bootstrap to make the website look good on mobile devices, as the code now is a bit too rough for my liking.
    Regardless, I hope it has been able to accurately show who I am.
