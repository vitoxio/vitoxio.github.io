							  <!-- <li><strong style="font-size: 25px;">Music: </strong> It's always been funny to me how certain combinations of sounds can produce an emotional response into someone. In an age where music in media, ie movies and games, is so atmospheric. I make melodic music that stands out from the background noise. Similar to how old video game music also conveys part of the message, instead of being forgetfull background noise.</li>
							  <li><strong style="font-size: 25px;">Writing: </strong> Maybe it would be better if I called this area poetry. Regardless, if you wish to read a couple of stanzas that elicit a deeper feeling, this is the place to go.</li>
							  <li><strong style="font-size: 25px;">Miscellaneous: </strong>This area hosts all those projects that don't fit any specific category. Game essays, school projects, and of course the existence of this very website. I feel that despite my main passion laying inside video games, it's just as important to showcase those other passions, as I am so much more than just a simple games maker. </li>
							  <li><strong style="font-size: 25px;">Contact: </strong> Despite not being a project, this area hold's my contact information as well my Resume. So, if by any reason you want to get in touch with me, or follow my progress on my social media, this is the place to be.</li> -->
