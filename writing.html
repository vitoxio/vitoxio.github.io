      <h2><a name="about">About Writing</a></h2>
      <div class="text_div">
          <p class="p">This section partakes on showcasing the writings I have made concerning game design. Most of these were made for school; nonetheless, they show some very interesting ideas I think are worth sharing.</p>
          <!-- <p class="p">Even if it may be a bit corny, every once in a while when the thoughts come to mind I like to write poetry. Here I show three projects. The first, When Inspiration Strikes,
          is made to embody the drive one gets when one gets inspired to do something, maybe it's to make art or to do some engineering project, regardless it takes control of oneself. The second, Relojero (it's in spanish), is a poem I made
          during eighth grade, which I then showed to a teacher. She liked it so much that the poem was added to the schools yearly literature magazine: La Papelera. The poem itself is a bit rough around the edges but I find
          that it speaks about the topic of death and time in a unique way, which hits home more than I remembered. Thirdly, Mi Amor Estelar, this is the first poem I ever made during sixth grade, it's about a sunflower talking about its
          love towards the sun as it slowly wilts away, again it is in Spanish.</p> -->

For this specific essay on Doki Doki Literature Club, I disected its use of the 4th wall, and how it bridges the gap between the player and the game.
