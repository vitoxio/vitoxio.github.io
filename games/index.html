                is a bullethell where you want to get shot. Where instead of bullets, you are shot by the musical notes of the music that's playing. All in a battle against the creator of the game (myself) in a game that 
                demolishes the 4th wall (if you could not tell by now) any means necesary.</p>
                <!-- In it battle against the games creator (me), as you battle through levels where the music played is the bullets thrown at you. All the whilst destroying the 4th wall.</p> -->
              <p class="p"><strong>Design:</strong> The games damage mechanic is a big inversion of the bullethell formula, where players normally avoid bullets at all costs. This forces players to always be aggresive as it's the only means of survival.
                Consequently, this makes movement more important, as it enforces survivabiltity and determines the damage output. 
                So unlike a normal roguelike where the player can sit in a corner avoiding damage, in here the player must be always active to progress.</p>
              <p class="p"><strong>Code:</strong> This project has some very interesting frameworks. For example, to implement the songs in the game I had to create txt files which encoded musical measures and the notes being played during the song. </p>

              <!-- OLD TEXT
              <p class="p">This is my most ambitious project yet, and as the time of writing I have been working on it for the last 4 years. My motto for the projec is to: Make everything myself. This includes, music, marketing, coding, spritework, etc. As I aspire to become a full fledged indie developer, I find that resourcefullness is key. I will admit I am not the best at artwork for example, but the experience has allowed me to lean into my strengths, using a retro style that disregards my lack of artistic ability. So even as I go into future projects, I will most likely not have to do everything myself. I will at least a better understanding of what goes on during every stage of production when making a game.</p>
              <p class="p">So what is the game about? So this is a tricky question to answer without spoiling the whole premise of the game. However, what I can say is that it takes the concept of the 4th wall break into its logical maximum. Moreover, I explore the whole concept of the Death of the Author, as I explore if what if the Author can still be kept alive inside a text, as I try to tackle Rolands Barthes.</p>
              <p class="p">In terms of pure game design, I ascribe to the idea of a Genre without Mechanic Design. In other words, I take out parts that are core to a genre, for example, a platformer without jumping. So in the case of this game, its a bullethell without ammo. So to shoot bullets, one must first get shot to be able to shoot back. Moreover, the notes that are shot from enemies, are actually the music that is being played in the music.</p>
              <p class="p">There is so much more I could talk about, regarding the game. However, I feel it's better for me to create my vision, and later talk about it. Also, I must say that I am making the game inside GameMakerStudio 2. Lastly, despite what the trailer says, I have moved the release date for 2022. Game development is a tricky and unpredictable business, so I'll delay it until its ready.</p>

            <p class="p"><strong>What is this?&nbsp;</strong><a href="https://github.com/vittorio-corbo/Equinox" class="in_line_link" target="_blank">Equinox</a> is a First Person Puzzler set in Space! 
              Where your ONLY mode of movement is a Grapple hook, with which you will have to fix the ship! </p>
            <!-- <p class="p"><strong>Game Design:&nbsp;</strong> This game tries to degamify the act of typing. The problem with most typing games is that they players type faster and faster until they fail. And while this is a fun way to measure typing speed, this is a terrible way to teach typing. As a kid you learn how to read not by being forced to read faster and faster, but rather by sheer time and practice. This is what this game does. </p> -->
            <!-- <p class="p"><strong>Engine:&nbsp;</strong>Unity.</p>
            <p class="p"><strong>When did I do this?&nbsp;</strong>This is a game I am currently making as a part of VGDev. </p> -->
            <p class="p"><strong>Design:&nbsp;</strong>grappling as a mechanic already gives players immense freedom for traversal. Removing gravity on top of that provides almost even more freedom. 
              However, as the game is a puzzler this limitless traversal posed problems, as the player could escape any linear puzzle segments. Thus we decided to make the game open world,
            with a strong emphasis in level design to try to recomend a natural progression along the ship, while still keeping an open MetroidVania nature to the game. </p>
            <p class="p"><strong>Role:&nbsp;</strong>I have been the leader of this project within Georgia Tech's game development club. Ontop of managing the project I have worked closely on the design.</p>
            <p class="p"><strong>Code:</strong> I coded ...</p>
            <!-- <p class="p"><strong>Design:&nbsp;</strong>. Lastly, this game builds of the ideas of Grapple Man (lower in this page),  </p> -->

            <p = class="p"> But you might be asking: what makes this typing game unique? Well its simple, it's the most bearbones and least "vidoegamey" typing game possible. At first this sounds like a huge boon for my game, until one realises how bad the average typing games is. As these games are overly gamified. The average typing game implores the user to type increasingly fast as enemies come onto the screen until they reach can't keep up anymore and die. However, I feel that typing is similar to how one learns how to read. One does not get better at reading by trying to speedrun a book, this is not how kids transition into reading childrens books to Harry Potter. This growth comes from routine practice. Which slowly as time goes on, as one reads more and more, one gets more familiar and comfortable reading, thus becoming a better reader. So it is this principle I used at the basis of my typing game. </p>
            <p = class="p">In the game, players are only required to type what is on screen, there is no music, no feedback for wrong keystrokes, nothing. So, it creats this safe environment where the worst of typers can practice without any negative feedback to deter their growth. So, the game is destilled to just the essence of typing. It's still a game, as there is a tug of war between what the player needs to type, vs the game, which makes the player need to write ridiculous lines to progress. The best thing is once the game is beaten, options are added to costumise the typing experience, so players can add errors made while typing, words per minute, etc. Allowing the game to be costumized to ones personal typing goals. Which is then further cemented by the ability to change the games .txt files, to whatever custom text the user wants to use. Which allows me to be able to still study my class notes in peace.

            <h3><strong>Engine:&nbsp;</strong>GameMaker Studio 2 || <strong>When did I do this?&nbsp;</strong>July 2020.</h3>
            <p class="p"><strong>What is this?&nbsp;</strong><a href="https://vitoxio.itch.io/alphabet" class="in_line_link" target="_blank">ALPHABET</a> was made for the GMTK 2020 Game Jam (ranked #434 out of 5477), whose theme was: Out of Control. And it is a fusion between twister and snake, in which each letter you grab changes your keybinds.</p>
            <p class="p"><strong>Design:&nbsp;</strong>The game fits the chaotic nature, as it fights the players inate muscle memory as keybinds are completely changed and morrover, the contortion on they keyboard itself. Moreover to the games arcady nature. The player is incited to replay and fight these reflexes.</p>
            <p class="p"><strong>Code:</strong> I coded ...</p>
            <!-- <p class="p">Two things I feel that sneak under the radar when playing the game, has to do with the games namesake: ALPHABET. When grabbing letters the player will notice that notes start to play. Most players will not understand why this music is playing, mainly due to how slow most players are.

            <p class="p"><strong>Cool Fact:&nbsp;</strong>as the player obtains letters, musical notes begin to play. Most players do not understand the nature of this, due to their lack of speed and thus the understanding of the music. However, the song that is playing is twinkle twinkle little star, which most people don't know is the same song as the alphabet, hence the games name.</p>

            <!-- OLD TEXT
            <p class="p">This game was made for the GMTK 2020 Game Jam. With the theme of: Out of Control. I feel that the best mindset of any Game Jam is to keep it simple. Feature creep is something that easily seeps into game production. So to keep things in check I always try to create only the most essential aspects of a game first, get them working, and only after, if there is time, add other features. So for this Jam, I decided to make a snake-like esque game in GameMakerStudio 2. The catch of the game is that when grabbing a letter, it changes the players keybindings into the letter they grabbed.</p>
            <p class="p">The idea of the game is to work similar to the family game Twister. Where the player must contort into strange positions to win. So ALPHABET messes with the players muscle memories, as they must fight their instincts to move around. This is then further elevated by the games arcady nature. As it incites players to get better times, making them replay the game to get better and fight their muscle memory.</p>
            <p class="p">Two things I feel that sneak under the radar when playing the game, has to do with the games namesake: ALPHABET. When grabbing letters the player will notice that notes start to play. Most players will not understand why this music is playing, mainly due to how slow most players are. However, the music that is playing is Twinkle-Twinkle little star, which is coincidentally the alphabet song. Hence, the games name.</p>
            <p class="p">As an aside, I am really proud of my performance on the Game Jam, as I came out 434 out of 5477 game submissions, which is especially good considering this was my first serious Game Jam, and moreover the largest Game Jam ever made at the time. As a whole, I hold this game close, not only because of how it did, but rather by giving an unique spin into the snake-like game genre.</p>

                is a bullethell where you want to get shot. Where instead of bullets, you are shot by the musical notes of the music that's playing. All in a battle against the creator of the game (myself) in a game that 
                demolishes the 4th wall (if you could not tell by now) any means necesary.</p>
              <p class="p"><strong>Design:</strong> The games damage mechanic is a big inversion of the bullethell formula, where players normally avoid bullets at all costs. This forces players to always be aggresive as it's the only means of survival.
                Consequently, this makes movement more important, as it enforces survivabiltity and determines the damage output. 
                So unlike a normal roguelike where the player can sit in a corner avoiding damage, in here the player must be always active to progress.</p>
              <p class="p"><strong>Code:</strong> This project has some very interesting frameworks. For example, to implement the songs in the game I had to create txt files which encoded musical measures and the notes being played during the song. </p>

              <!-- OLD TEXT
              <p class="p">This is my most ambitious project yet, and as the time of writing I have been working on it for the last 4 years. My motto for the projec is to: Make everything myself. This includes, music, marketing, coding, spritework, etc. As I aspire to become a full fledged indie developer, I find that resourcefullness is key. I will admit I am not the best at artwork for example, but the experience has allowed me to lean into my strengths, using a retro style that disregards my lack of artistic ability. So even as I go into future projects, I will most likely not have to do everything myself. I will at least a better understanding of what goes on during every stage of production when making a game.</p>
              <p class="p">So what is the game about? So this is a tricky question to answer without spoiling the whole premise of the game. However, what I can say is that it takes the concept of the 4th wall break into its logical maximum. Moreover, I explore the whole concept of the Death of the Author, as I explore if what if the Author can still be kept alive inside a text, as I try to tackle Rolands Barthes.</p>
              <p class="p">In terms of pure game design, I ascribe to the idea of a Genre without Mechanic Design. In other words, I take out parts that are core to a genre, for example, a platformer without jumping. So in the case of this game, its a bullethell without ammo. So to shoot bullets, one must first get shot to be able to shoot back. Moreover, the notes that are shot from enemies, are actually the music that is being played in the music.</p>
              <p class="p">There is so much more I could talk about, regarding the game. However, I feel it's better for me to create my vision, and later talk about it. Also, I must say that I am making the game inside GameMakerStudio 2. Lastly, despite what the trailer says, I have moved the release date for 2022. Game development is a tricky and unpredictable business, so I'll delay it until its ready.</p>

            <p class="p"><strong>When did I do this?&nbsp;</strong>This is a game I am currently making as a part of VGDev. </p> -->
            <p class="p"><strong>Design:&nbsp;</strong>grappling as a mechanic already gives players immense freedom for traversal. Removing gravity on top of that provides almost even more freedom. 
              However, as the game is a puzzler this limitless traversal posed problems, as the player could escape any linear puzzle segments. Thus we decided to make the game open world,
            with a strong emphasis in level design to try to recomend a natural progression along the ship, while still keeping an open MetroidVania nature to the game. </p>
            <p class="p"><strong>Role:&nbsp;</strong>I have been the leader of this project within Georgia Tech's game development club. Ontop of managing the project I have worked closely on the design.</p>

            <!-- OLD TEXT
            <p class="p">This game was made for the GMTK 2020 Game Jam. With the theme of: Out of Control. I feel that the best mindset of any Game Jam is to keep it simple. Feature creep is something that easily seeps into game production. So to keep things in check I always try to create only the most essential aspects of a game first, get them working, and only after, if there is time, add other features. So for this Jam, I decided to make a snake-like esque game in GameMakerStudio 2. The catch of the game is that when grabbing a letter, it changes the players keybindings into the letter they grabbed.</p>
            <p class="p">The idea of the game is to work similar to the family game Twister. Where the player must contort into strange positions to win. So ALPHABET messes with the players muscle memories, as they must fight their instincts to move around. This is then further elevated by the games arcady nature. As it incites players to get better times, making them replay the game to get better and fight their muscle memory.</p>

I wanted another way to study through my notes, as I found that reading them out wasn't as engaging.

            <p class="p"> This was all this idea was for quite some time. A simple code that would take a text file to type out.

              <p class="p"> <strong>Design: </strong> This game was an experiment on 3D level design. The ability to teleport anywhere gives many limitations to level design which makes creating puzzles even harder. Hence adding see throgh walls and ungrappable walls was crucial. Nonetheless, the abilty to just point and click simplifies the experience, hence players do not need to worry about systems such as movmeent (WASD) or gravity when playing.</p>

              <p class="p"> This is a very simple project which I made for another gamejam. this not too cool, but it was fun </p>
              <p = class="p"> But you might be asking: what makes this typing game unique? Well its simple, it's the most bearbones and least "vidoegamey" typing game possible. At first this sounds like a huge boon for my game, until one realises how bad the average typing games is. As these games are overly gamified. The average typing game implores the user to type increasingly fast as enemies come onto the screen until they reach can't keep up anymore and die. However, I feel that typing is similar to how one learns how to read. One does not get better at reading by trying to speedrun a book, this is not how kids transition into reading childrens books to Harry Potter. This growth comes from routine practice. Which slowly as time goes on, as one reads more and more, one gets more familiar and comfortable reading, thus becoming a better reader. So it is this principle I used at the basis of my typing game. </p>
              <p = class="p">In the game, players are only required to type what is on screen, there is no music, no feedback for wrong keystrokes, nothing. So, it creats this safe environment where the worst of typers can practice without any negative feedback to deter their growth. So, the game is destilled to just the essence of typing. It's still a game, as there is a tug of war between what the player needs to type, vs the game, which makes the player need to write ridiculous lines to progress. The best thing is once the game is beaten, options are added to costumise the typing experience, so players can add errors made while typing, words per minute, etc. Allowing the game to be costumized to ones personal typing goals. Which is then further cemented by the ability to change the games .txt files, to whatever custom text the user wants to use. Which allows me to be able to still study my class notes in peace.

I disect their design, understanding what makes them tick, which then provides me a jumping point when then creating my own. In any artform, one needs to be introspective to know what came before, to be able to create what comes next. For this specific essay on Doki Doki Literature Club, I disected its use of the 4th wall, and how it bridges the gap between the player and the game. And And without spoiling too much, it's this kind of wall break, that I am trying to take into a whole other level, as I work in The Un-BEATable Game.</p> -->
